Distributed Array Library with Extensible Communication (DALEC)

Naming
======

DALEC is an intentional misspelling of the Serbo-Croation word dalek, meaning "far" or "distant" [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dalek], which is related to the use of remote memory access communication for "distant" (aka remote) data.

Function
========

DALEC is designed to provide many of the same things that Global Arrays [http://hpc.pnl.gov/globalarrays/] does, but with a more modern C interface.
