Distributed Array Library with Extensible Communication (DALEC)

Naming
======

DALEC is an intentional misspelling of the Serbo-Croation word dalek, meaning "far" or "distant" [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dalek], which is related to the use of remote memory access communication for "distant" (aka remote) data.

The misspelling also avoids the BBC trademark on "Dalek", which is apparently unrelated to the Serbo-Croation word "dalek" but rather may be derived from the Norwegian word "d√•rlig", meaning "bad" [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%A5rlig].

Function
========

DALEC is designed to provide many of the same things that Global Arrays [http://hpc.pnl.gov/globalarrays/] does, but with a more modern C interface.
