Distributed Array Library with Extensible Communication (DALEC)

Naming
======

DALEC is an intentional misspelling of the Serbo-Croation word [dalek](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dalek), meaning "far" or "distant", which is related to the use of remote memory access communication for "distant" (aka remote) data.

Function
========

DALEC is designed to provide many of the same things that [Global Arrays](http://hpc.pnl.gov/globalarrays/) does, but with more modern interfaces and useful features like thread-safety.
